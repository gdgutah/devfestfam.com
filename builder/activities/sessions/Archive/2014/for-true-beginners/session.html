  In this session we will provide an overview of development and programming for the person who is interested, but knows nothing. We'll describe different programming languages, various development purposes (e.g. mobile devices, websites, personal computers, etc.), and we'll share resources and approaches for getting started in each of these. We'll also cover some suggestions and principles for learning on your own, since most beginners will want to continue learning on their own after leaving this conference.
