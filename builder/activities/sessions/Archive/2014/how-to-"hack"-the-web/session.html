  Learn some basic, useful tools for "hacking" the web. We're going to cover popular tools that web developers use every day for building and tweaking websites. You can use these same tools to learn more about web development, doing things like looking at the guts of others' web pages, tweaking the look/feel/functionality of a live site, and ultimately reverse engineering your own test site using another website that you like.
