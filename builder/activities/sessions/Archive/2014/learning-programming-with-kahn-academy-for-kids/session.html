  Khan Academy has recently added a computer science section that makes learning to write code very interactive. It includes a very innovative way of letting you see code as it is written, and modify it at any time so that you know exactly what everything does. It is free and runs in a browser, so as long as you have a computer with a network connection you will be able to write code and immediately see what it does in the browser. This session will give a quick overview of what Khan Academy has to offer students learning how to program, and some ideas of what it would be like to use this resource to learn how to write your own code.
