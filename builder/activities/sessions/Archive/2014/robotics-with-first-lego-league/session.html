  Have you ever wanted to build and program your own robot? What if you could enter your robot in a competition that had the feeling of a sports game? FIRST is an acronym, with means "For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology." This organization has a Lego League, where teams of students (up to 10 per team) build and program robots using the Lego Mindstorms kits to complete different challenges in a competition. This session will introduce you to what FIRST Lego League is, and will let you see first-hand what a FLL competition is like. It will also include ideas of how you can join a FLL team, or start one of your own. Come see out what all of the excitement is about!
