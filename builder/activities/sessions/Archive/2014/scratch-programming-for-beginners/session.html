  Scratch is a programming language that was designed to be used by people young and old who have never programmed before. Developed by MIT, it is an easy way to learn the concepts of programming while using drag and drop to create your own interactive stories, games and animations. Scratch also makes it very easy for you to share your creations with others online. Want to make an online and interactive birthday card for your Grandmother? Do you have an idea for a game that you would like to build and share with others? This sessions will give you an overview of what Scratch is, and some ideas for the kind of things that you can do with it.
