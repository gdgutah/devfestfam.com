  We'll play "Robot Turtles" (http://www.robotturtles.com/) which I've used to teach my 4 and 6 (now 5 and 7) year old children some basic programming concepts and spacial reasoning. They love to play the game and experiment with different rules. This is targeted at children younger than 8 years old (some older children might enjoy it as well).
