    | DevFestFamily is not a typical tech conference, as it's focus is on the entire family. With so many jobs being
    | replaced by software, the importance of teaching Utah's children the skills of coding has never been higher.
    | DevFestFamily aims to bring code to those who have never coded, and help train those who are already familiar with
    | coding principles. With this we hope to prepare Utahn's to cope with a job market that is dramatically shifting
    | towards development jobs.
